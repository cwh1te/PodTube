# PodTube

This is a simple script that allows you to subscribe to YouTube channels as if they were podcasts. Videos are downloaded and then converted to MP3 using ffmpeg.

Ensure that you have ffmpeg installed before attempting to run this.

This project also depends on the following Github repositories:
* https://github.com/NFicano/pytube
* https://github.com/cwh1te/HandyLib

A more detailed readme as well as additional features are planned.
